//to remove an alias the user needs to submit //a userdata entry with type removeAlias 
//NO MORE ALIASES

to get mostRecentData

function getData()
	//sort through userdata by time
	//do all the changes one by one



function getUser()
	return{

	key:
	
}

when creating an alias create a link on the id 

add Link from Key to id — tracking all ids that a key can log in to. So that when we can populate a list of ids before a user logs.

add Link from id to Key — so that we can access all keys that can log into an account from the identity hash. —> this replaces aliases in the userdata
